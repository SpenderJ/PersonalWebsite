        <h5 class="description">
          My name is Jules Spender. I was born in 1998, in Paris. After a Scientific bac, I joined EPITECH. After having validated
          my first year there, I decided to attend 42 "Piscine" in July 2017. I got accepted and joined 42 on november 2017. On september
          2018 I joined WiserSkills to attend a 5 months internship. I then studied 4 months at 42 Silicon Valley exploring data science and advanced
          algorithmic project.<br/>I am now working as a Data Scientist at Engie E&C on a student contract completing my master degree.
          <br>
          I've practiced tennis in competition for 8 years before joining Renault's rugby team in FFSE. Sport addict, I've been sailing
          since my youngest age and since 4 years, during summer, I've been working as a monitor mostly in windsurf. I'm also a graduated
          tennis referee (A1).
